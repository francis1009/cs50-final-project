# Health App!
This project was done as a final project for the CS50x : Introduction to Computer Science course of 2019.
A demo of this app can be found [here](https://youtu.be/nBEDeDciYg0).


## What is the project about?
In this project, I've created a web app called Health app, which has a variety of functions and information to help users better
their health and plan their caloric intake better. This functions and information can be accessed using the navbar.


## Home page
In the home page, we can see 3 cards which basically act as shortcuts to access the different options from the navbar. A bit of information
is given on what the options may do for the user.


## Health
In the health section, the user can read up on the various benefits of staying and eating healthy.


## Calorie Tracker
In the calorie tracker section, the user is required to either register or log in to use the function. If the user is not logged in,
the function will prompt the user to register or log in. After the user has done either, the user can use the calorie tracker function
which allows the user to add calories to a specific date. Once added, the user will be sent to his profile page where he can view his
number of calories consumed on what day, in a table format.


## Calculator
In the calculator session, the user is prompted to choose one of the 3 health calculators provided. These calculators include the Body
Mass Index (BMI) Calculator, Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) Calculator, and Waist-to-Hip Ratio (WHR) Calculator. When a user clicks on
one of the calculators, the user is given various information on what the calculator is about, and why it is important. The calculator
also allows for user input, so as to obtain a value with which they can compare to a table to see how healthy they are.


## Profile
To the right of the navbar is a dropdown menu with the user's username. When clicked on, it will display 'Profile', 'Change Username',
and 'Change Password' as the options. 'Change Username' allows the user to change his or her name if the user feels dissatisfied with
their current username. However, if the username they want already exists, they are not allowed to change to that. 'Change Password'
is similar in that it allows the user to change their password.

In the profile page, the user is able to view his number of calories consumed on what day, in a table format. The user is also able to
delete specific dates if they were to make a mistake in inputting the number of calories consumed on a specific date. If the user
does not have any calorie consumed, it will display a 'Nothing to see here' value on the table.
